# Yelp Replica

Live Code: https://kimflores-yelp.netlify.app

# How It's Made:
### Tech used: 
My task was to replicate the Yelp homepage with **HTML** and **CSS**. I was given a screenshot as reference and implemented media queries for responsiveness.

# Lessons Learned:
I got more familiar with the CSS background-image property and all properties related to background so it was fun to play around with. 
Applying responsiveness to the site with media queries was exciting to see what content can be taken away or seen. So, it was a interesting applying "Mobile First" to decide what I believed was important content for the user based on their screen size.
